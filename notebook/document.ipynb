Today's data-driven applications \\nrely heavily on robust analytics to improve user experience, make \\ninformed decisions, and optimize performance. However, existing \\nthird-party analytics solutions present limitations around data privacy \\nand control. This motivated the creation of an in-house solution that \\nbalances functionality, scalability, and deployment ease. \\nObjective: Design an API capable of collecting large volumes of \\ntime-series user interaction data, store them efficiently, and allow \\nflexible queries for aggregated insights. To ensure easy deployment and \\nconsistent operations across various platforms, containerization with \\nDocker was implemented. \\nThis report details the technical challenges, the chosen software stack, \\ndevelopment practice, and deployment methodology.
